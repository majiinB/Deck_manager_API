/**
 * Schema definition for creating a deck using Zod.
 *
 * This schema validates the structure of a deck object, ensuring that:
 * - `title` is a required string with a minimum and maximum length.
 * - `description` is a required string with a minimum and maximum length.
 * - `coverPhoto` is an optional string that must match a specific Firebase Storage URL pattern.
 * - `flashcards` is an optional array of objects validated by the `flashcardSchema`.
 *
 * The schema is designed to enforce data integrity for deck creation in the application.
